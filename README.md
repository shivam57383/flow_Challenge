# Project Title

Movie Contract 

## Description

The Movie Contract is a simple smart contract written in the Cadence programming language for the Flow blockchain. It allows users to add and retrieve information about movies, such as their titles and release years. The smart contract defines a Movie struct with two properties (Title and ReleaseYear) and a Movies storage that is implemented as a dictionary with movie titles as keys and Movie objects as values. The contract includes an addMovie function that allows users to add a new movie to the list by creating a new Movie object and storing it in the Movies dictionary using the movie's title as the key. The contract can be used as a foundation for building more complex movie-related applications on the Flow blockchain.

## Getting Started
